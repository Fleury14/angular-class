        <h1>Lesson 32: Preparing for our room form</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Before we go over our all the details about our form, let's get some basic HTML first. This won't really be a lesson per se, I just want to go over the anatomy of our form first.</p>
    <h4>If you already copy/pasted the form code from class earlier, and you got through it without errors, you can basically skip all of this until we get to the write functionality.</h4>
    <p>Here is my base HTML. Keep in mind that my room form TS file is basically empty. There's no directives in here, just straight HTML.</p>

    <p>First off, everything is wrapped in a form tag, that's very important. We start off with an option/select dropdown with only one option for now. Directly underneath is a warning message that we will want to display if the user hasn't selected a reason.</p>
    <p>Next we have have a couple of email input tags for the user to enter their e-mail and to confirm.</p>
    <p>Underneath that, theres a couple of time inputs for the start and end time.</p>
    <p>There's a checkbox underneath making sure the user agrees to clean up because nobody likes a dirty room.</p>
    <p>To round out our form we have a submit type input that will be used for... submitting.</p>
    <p>Last up, we have some warnings underneath. These will probably need to be displayed conditionally; we want to warn them that changes haven't been saved (this will help with a bonus lesson much later on), and if there are fields that haven't been filled out.</p>
    <p>Let's wrap it up here. Style up the form however you like. In the next lesson, we will start adding some directives and give this bad boy some functionality.</p>
